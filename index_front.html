            Recently, I was listening to a cracking episode of the podcast*,*
            where the topic of conversation with guest Pulkit Agrawal
            (Co-Founder of Chameleon) was how to nail user onboarding. Agrawal
            described how video games have been successfully introducing new
            products to players for years and that designers can learn a thing
            or two about onboarding from iconic titles

          <p class="p_text">
            Anyone who has played Monster Hunter World, knows just how complex
            this game is. As the name suggests, you play as an aspiring hunter
            whose goal is to defeat creatures of all shapes and sizes to help
            protect the townsfolk, whilst getting paid handsomely for doing so.
          </p>
          <p class="p_text">
            Developer, Capcom, does a great job of getting players to complete
            tasks quickly, all the while teaching them the core mechanics of the
            game (does this sound familiar?). But, when it comes to introducing
            new mechanics like skill progression, weapon upgrades and alchemy,
            the honeymoon period comes to a rapid end.
          </p>
          <p class="p_text">
            In quick succession, players are introduced to mechanic after
            mechanic via instructional popups, embedded with pages full of
            detailed text. I spent more time reading about how to play than I
            did actually playing. Worst of all, when it came to using a new
            mechanic, I had forgotten most of the instructions from the
            tutorial. Frustrated at having to go back and relearn how to
            progress my character, suddenly playing Monster Hunter was more of a
            chore than a pleasure and quickly fell into the ‘Too Hard Basket’.
            Now, I’m lucky if I boot up this game once a year.

            George Fan, designer of Plants vs. Zombies, outlines that a players
            <u>
              willingness to learn is directly correlated with time invested</u
            >
            . The longer a player has played a game, the more receptive they are
            to learn new information about it. This same logic can apply to
            products. Too much information, too quickly, exceeds our willingness
            to learn and causes us to feel overwhelmed, confused, or frustrated.
            In turn, creating friction and increasing the likelihood of walking
            away, never to be seen again.

            When it comes to designing an onboarding experience, too much, too
            soon is a bad thing. Designers should avoid overwhelming users with
            irrelevant information at the start of their journey. Yes…the
            content might be super important to the product, but ask yourself,
            is now the best time to share this information?
          </p>
          <p class="p_text">
            The more relevant the information to the specific action or area
            under consideration the better. In fact, onboarding should be looked
            at less like a single moment in time (e.g. first login) and more of
            a midterm journey over the first few weeks or interactions with a
            particular feature. Help users when they are ready to be helped to
            avoid exceeding their willingness to learn.

          <h2 class="h2_text">Lesson #3: Personalisation = Engagement</h2>
          <p class="p_text">
            Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the most anticipated games of the last
            decade and one that will not easily be forgotten (and not just
            because of its ). Developer, CD Projekt Red, pushed the boundaries
            to set a new standard for what personalisation means in video games.
          </p>
          <p class="p_text">
            What Cyberpunk did so differently was give players the freedom to
            experience the game how they wanted to play it. Instead of being
            constrained by a single narrative, players had the choice of three
            different paths. This choice dictated the first hour or two of the
            game, unlike other games that force players to make upfront
            decisions that don t really matter.
          </p>
          <p class="p_text">
            After spending way too much time customizing my character (and I
            mean way too much time) it was satisfying to see my decision on
            which story to follow come immediately into play. I started to think
            ‘if I’m making decisions like this now, what’s around the corner?’.
            This anticipation hooked me in and kept me coming back for more.
          </p>
          <p class="p_text">
            While not every product can have the same level of personalization
            as a game, tailoring the onboarding experience to the individual
            user can be extremely powerful in driving engagement and retention.
          </p>
          <p class="p_text">
            Personalisation can be as simple as collecting user interests and
            then tailoring content to match. Reddit does this supremely well in
            its onboarding, capturing what users are interested in and
            recommending subreddits for users to join. Thus, getting people onto
            the platform and scrolling through content that they actually care
            about from their first interaction.

          <p class="p_text">
            Next time you’re working on an onboarding experience, try shifting
            the perspective from a one size fits all approach and explore how to
            create a more tailored experience that aligns with why the user came
            to you in the first place.

          <p class="p_text">
            Pulkit Agrawal was spot on! There are so many lessons that we, as
            designers, can take from video games when it comes to creating an
            epic onboarding experience. Just remember, a user s first
            interaction with a product has the potential to be a make or break
            moment. So, let s stack the odds in your favor by applying tried,
            tested, and true principles from the video game industry
          </p>
          <p class="p_text">
            So, brush the dust off your console of choice, boot up a game, and
            get studying. It’s time to prove your parents wrong, you weren t
            wasting time playing video games, you were preparing yourself for
            designing banging onboarding experiences
